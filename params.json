VSCF and VCI are analogous to HF and CI methods in electronic structure theory, although for solving the vibrational wavefunction instead of the electronic one. \r\nThe program needs an external software for building a potential energy surface (PES) in the quartic force field representation (QFF). QUMVIA is able to use Gaussian, Gamess and Lio for this.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n------------\r\n* Intel MKL (Math Kernel Library).\r\n* Intel Fortran compiler (can be obtained with a non-comercial licence).\r\n* GNU Make.\r\n* Lio compiled libraries (for the Lio compatible version).\r\n\r\nCOMPILATION\r\n-----------\r\nQUMVIA can be compilated in CPU version, which only permits the use of Gaussian or GAMESS for the PES buildup, or with in a Lio-compatible version, using GNU make. For example, the following compiles the CPU version:\r\n```\r\nmake cpu\r\n```\r\nAvailable options:\r\n* _cpu_: compiles QUMVIA version without Lio interface.\r\n* _lio_: compiles the Lio-compatible version of the code.\r\n\r\nThe compilation process creates an executable binary file inside the bin folder under the qumvia root directory, called qumvia.lio for the Lio-compatible version or a qumvia.cpu for the non-lio-compatible one. The final location of the qumvia executable should be added to the path environment variable.\r\n\r\nTESTING\r\n-------\r\n\r\nFrom the qumvia root directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\n cd test/h2co-roman\r\n bash runtest.bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompare the final lines of test.oqv with correct-results.dat\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
